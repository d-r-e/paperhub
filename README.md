# PaperHub

**_Note: The name "PaperHub" is a placeholder and may change in future updates._**

## Overview

**PaperHub** is a web-based tool designed to monitor and track the medium- to long-term impact of scientific papers. Often, research papers with significant societal potential gain momentary media attention, but it's challenging to keep up with their actual influence and application in the scientific community over time. PaperHub aims to bridge this gap by providing a system that tracks citations, evaluates credibility, measures media impact, and notifies users of notable developments.

## Key Features

- **Citation Tracking:** Monitor the citation count of research papers to measure their impact within the scientific community.
- **Credibility Metrics:** Assess the reliability of publications through metrics like journal impact factors and author credentials.
- **Media Monitoring:** Keep track of mentions and discussions in news outlets and social media platforms, providing insights into public and media interest.
- **Custom Alerts:** Receive notifications when certain milestones or trends are reached, such as a significant increase in citations or media mentions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive dashboard to manage and visualize the tracking of research papers.

## Why PaperHub?

Scientific research often makes headlines, but understanding its real-world impact and adoption over time is crucial. PaperHub empowers researchers, journalists, and enthusiasts to follow the progression of scientific papers beyond the initial buzz, helping to identify genuinely influential work and track its influence in society and science.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Django, Celery (for background task processing), and GitHub OAuth for user authentication. Google and other SSO will come later.
- **Frontend:** Angular and Bootstrap for responsive design.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for storing paper information, citations, and media mentions.
- **Third-Party APIs:** Integration with GitHub, news APIs, scientific databases (e.g., Semantic Scholar, CrossRef).
- **Task Queue:** Celery with Redis for periodic updates of citation counts and media tracking.
