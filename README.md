## Overview

In the scientific world, groundbreaking papers frequently make headlines, hailed for their potential to revolutionize medicine, technology, and society. However, many of these "potentially useful" studies never progress beyond initial buzz and promises, leaving their real-world impact uncertain. This disconnect between scientific potential and tangible societal benefit often goes unnoticed due to the difficulty in tracking these developments over time.
